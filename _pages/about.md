Hi! I am a rising fourth-year undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley, majoring in physics, computer science, and applied mathematics. I am currently a summer research intern at Apple.

I am broadly interested in theoretical and computational physics. My past and present research includes pattern formation on growing domains with Prof. [Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch), atmospheric dynamics of the outer planets with Dr. [Mike Wong](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mikewong/bio.php), and spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride with Prof. [Tongcang Li](https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang/) at Purdue University.

On the teaching side, I am a 2-time Undergraduate Student Instructor (uGSI) for Math 1B (Calculus 2). I have also been a tutor for CS 61A (The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) and a mentor for [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/). In Fall 2024, I will be a uGSI for Math 54 (Linear Algebra and Differential Equations).

Service and outreach are very important to me. I am the current co-president of the [UC Berkeley Society of Physics Students](https://sps.berkeley.edu). Previously, I served as the Outreach Chair for which I taught physics to elementary school students in collaboration with [Bay Area Scientists Inspiring Students (BASIS)](https://crscience.org/educators/BASIS/). I also serve on multiple physics department committees for improving the undergraduate curriculum and promoting undergraduate research opportunities.

Previously, I attended Corona del Mar High School and took additional mathematics courses at University of California, Irvine. Long ago, I built iOS apps and spent a lot of time [answering questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5644794/tktsubota).

My CV is available [here](/files/troy_tsubota_CV.pdf).
