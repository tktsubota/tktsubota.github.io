Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley, majoring in physics, computer science, and applied mathematics. I am broadly interested in theoretical and computational physics.

I currently perform research on quantum sensing with Prof. [Joel Moore](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/joel-moore) and pattern formation with Prof. [Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch). Previously, I studied outer planet atmospheres with Dr. [Mike Wong](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mikewong/bio.php) and two-dimensional materials with Prof. [Tongcang Li](https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang/) (Purdue University). Last summer, I was a hardware research intern at Apple.

Teaching, service, and outreach are very important to me. I have taught calculus and linear algebra as an Undergraduate Student Instructor (teaching assistant). I have also been involved in several organizations, including the [UC Berkeley Society of Physics Students (SPS)](https://sps.studentorg.berkeley.edu), [Bay Area Scientists Inspiring Students (BASIS)](https://crscience.org/educators/BASIS/), and [Computer Science Mentors (CSM)](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/).

My CV is available [here](/files/troy_tsubota_CV.pdf).
