Here are some resources I have developed as an Undergraduate Student Instructor (uGSI) at UC Berkeley.

Math 54 (Fall 2024)
-----
Basic linear algebra; matrix arithmetic and determinants. Vector spaces; inner product spaces. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; orthogonality, symmetric matrices. Linear second-order differential equations; first-order systems with constant coefficients. Fourier series.

Math 1B (Fall 2023, Spring 2024)
-----
Techniques of integration; applications of integration. Infinite sequences and series. First-order ordinary differential equations. Second-order ordinary differential equations; oscillation and damping; series solutions of ordinary differential equations.

### Fall 2023 (Prof. Mark Haiman)

* [Final review sheet](/files/fa23_math1b_final_review_sheet.pdf)
* 82 true-false questions ([problems](/files/fa23_math1b_true_false.pdf) and [solutions](/files/fa23_math1b_true_false_solutions.pdf))
<!-- Include warm up problems and solutions when you get the time! -->

### Desmos demos

* [Power series (interval of convergence) demo](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qonqs8dug9)
